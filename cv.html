    This weekend, you will be building a personal website of your own. You'll be able to use this website as a professional reference for your resume and portfolio of projects, and, of course, to let people know who you are. There are a few specific requirements we're looking for, but we've tried to keep those as broad as possible to allow you all to be as creative as you individually want. The skies the limit with how you design your website (as long, of course, as you keep it safe for work).
